= Ansible Lightspeed Intelligent Assistant

Ansible Lightspeed Intelligent Assistant (ALIA) is an AI powered chatbot.

== Ansible Lightspeed Intelligent Assistant Architecture

ALIA is part of the Ansible Automation Platform Operator and it needs a model service provider.

== Guardrails

ALIA is designed only to answer Ansible-related questions, and
it will generally attempt to reject questions that are unrelated. If you try hard
enough, you can probably get it to do something it wasn't explicitly designed to do. If
you see something bad, be sure to report it using the feedback feature. We will always
do our best to improve the quality and safety of the system.


== Login to ALIA

Log into your AAP UI using the credentials provided on the original screen where you 
found the link to this lab guide. Once you have logged-in, you should see the 
ALIA button near the top-right corner of the mashead

== Starter Questions

Start out by asking questions like:

* How do I create a survey in a job template?
* What is automation mesh?
* What is the difference between job templates and workflow templates?
* How can I create a custom execution environment?
* What are the best practices around building inventories?
* What should I use to run playbooks locally, ansible-playbook or ansible-navigator?
* How can I do windows automation?
* What is event-driven ansible?
* How do I upgrade my AAP?


== Roadmap

ALIA is evolving quickly, and there are many exciting features
on the roadmap. The two most exciting ones are:

* Integration with Ansible Automation components
  Users will be able to ask questions about their Ansible Automation Platform
  environment, and ALIA will be able to provide answers based on the context of
  the environment. This will include things like job templates, inventories,
  credentials, and other Ansible Automation Platform components. 

* Diagnostic capabilities
  ALIA will be able to interrogate the Ansible Automation Platform environment 
  and answers questions e.g. "Why did this job fail?" or "What is the status of this job?".
  This will be done using the Ansible Automation Platform API and will provide
  users with a more complete picture of their Ansible Automation Platform
  environment.
